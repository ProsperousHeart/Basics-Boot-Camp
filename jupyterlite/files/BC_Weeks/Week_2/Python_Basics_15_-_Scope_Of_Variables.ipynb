    "\n",
    "**Scope** defines the set of rules which tell us how and where a variable or identifier can be searched - or the accessibility of an object. Depending upon when and where the identifier was instantiated (created) you may not have the ability to access it when you call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because not all data or variables can be accessed from anywhere in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a function for example, the variables brought inside are brought into scope of that function. (Also known as it's local namespace.) Python then makes an educated guess on whether they are local or global.\n",

    "Some key notes to keep in mind regarding global variables ...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the **global** keyword should not be used, as functions are intended to be \"black boxes\" that interact with the \"outside world\" through inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Globals should **NEVER** change!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Changing a global state makes it impossible to unit test code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If you change your globals, you can inadvertently create bugs in your code as well as incorrect calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. when you create a variable within a function, you cannot access it outside that function\n",
    "\n",
    "6. you must be careful when passing information back and forth to avoid making changes to external variables within a function\n",
    "\n",
    "7. you can access variables created outside of your function by declaring **global** inside the function\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some additional resources to help you understand this important aspect of functions:\n",
    "- [PEP 227](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0227/) - Statically Nested Scopes (written for version 2.1)\n",
    "- [PEP 3104](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3104/) - Access to Names in Outer Scopes (written for version 3.0) ... also known as the specification for the nonlocal statement\n",
