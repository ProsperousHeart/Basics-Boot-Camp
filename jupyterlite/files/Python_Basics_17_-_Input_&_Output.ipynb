    "\n",
    "**access_mode**\n",
    "Determines the mode with which to open the file with. This is an _optional_ parameter, and the default access mode is read (`r`).\n",

    "|----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| r | Opens a file for **reading only**. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. _(default mode)_ |\n",
    "| r+ | Opens a file for **both reading & writing**. File pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. |\n",
    "| w | Opens a file for **writing only** ... Ovewrwrites if the file exists, otherwise creates a new file. |\n",
    "| w+ | Opens a file for **both writing & reading** ... Ovewrwrites if the file exists, otherwise creates a new file for writing and reading. |\n",
    "| a | Opens a file for **appending** with the pointer at the end of the file, if it exists. If file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing. |\n",
    "| a+ | Opens a file for **both appending and reading** with the pointer at the end, if the file exists. If file does not exist, a new one is created for reading/writing. |\n",
