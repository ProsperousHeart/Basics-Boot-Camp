"""Python Basics Bootcamp Week 1 HW 1 - Simple Calculator
https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/Basics-Boot-Camp/blob/main/HW/Requirements/W1H1-Calc.md

This script allows a user to utilize the command prompt (console)
to do simple computations.

This tool provides options on screen. When user input is received
from command prompt, a certain action will take place.

This script will require that module Math be installed.
However, the initial phase of this will be uploaded to GitHub
with just the bare code -no functions or exception handling.

This file can not yet be imported as a module with functions
- functions are covered in week 2.
