# Week 2 Implementation Work:  Input / Output
# https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/Basics-Boot-Camp/blob/main/HW/Requirements/W3H1-IO.md
#
# Here is the process I follow for this phase (see HW1 Week 2) ...
#
#   1 - write out the comments of expected functions
#   2 - create those functions with proper docstrings, logging, and pass ONLY
#       NOTE:  pass is a null operation (nothing happens) and is therefore
#              only used as a placeholder when no code needs to be executed
#              such as when a function doesn't do anything yet or have logging
#   3 - tie the functions together in your __main__
#   4 - test the logic with print or logging statements

# This section will set up logging. More information on logging can be found here:

#   NOTES:
#       - some of the logging is not consistent throughout ... this is
#           intentional so you can see other ways of leaving breadcrumbs
#           for your future self
#       - as mentioned before, there is no one right way to code, so several
#           different styles have been shared here
#       - logging levels:  https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels

# 1. read in file - eventually ask for location of file
# 2. search for text phrase
# 3. keep a log file
#     - Have a new file created for each day - no overwrite
#     - Be sure to ALWAYS include the following:
#       - search phrase used
#       - number of times found (if any)
#       - separator for when you have multiple runs
#     - If not found, notate in log file.
#     - If found, notate line number in log file.
# ===================================================================
# Nice to haves:
#   - Ability for user to turn on or off printing line in log file.
#   - Ability to print synopsis of run on CLI
#   - Ability to choose whether capitalization matters
