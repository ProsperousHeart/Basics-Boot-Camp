Congratulations on completing [week 1](../../Week_1) training for Python Basics!

This folder is where you will put your [implementation work for Week 1](../README.MD).

# What Is The Student_Files Section For?

This is a place where you will store your implementation work - if you're comfortable.

You do not have to, but there are several benefits.

## Benefits

Here are a few reasons why you should utilize this option as part of your bootcamp:
- this is a great place to show some of your work as part of your portfolio

- you will get more experience using an industry tool

- you will find processes that work best for you when collaborating with others

- your time to complete tasks will become shorter & more streamlined as it becomes a habit

- you can see what others have done & share your own work

## What About The instructor's Work?

When available, you can find my answers to Week 1's homework in the [prosperousheart](prosperousheart/) folder!

But **don't** cheat yourself. Really take the time to think through your problems before searching for an answer. This will be the biggest learning curve for your success - personal opinion of course.

    This suggestion is based on my college experience.

Why? 2 big reasons:

1. to become a master faster, you must do more of the things that will help strengthen your neurons (creating a habit)

2. Google will always be there - this is your time to stretch your understanding & build additional critical thinking skills

# How To Submit Homework

The intention behind this bootcamp is to give you a basic foundation of python programming as well as some useful tools.

While you may always email me your code, it is going to be much better for you if you learn how to utilize Github - specifically [collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests).

## The Process

### Initial Setup

You will only need to do this one time - and that's forking my repository. (Yes, you will be forking all of the documents, images, and code into your own Github account.)

Be sure to follow the rest of setup process as outlined in [collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests).

### Rules & Expectations

Everything you do a pull request for to my repo will be reviewed - if you are a current student. If it does not affect any of the main files and you have only updated your own student folder, then it will be confirmed and integrated into my main code here.

Common rules:
1. NEVER save password information into your code. It will be rejected with comments as to why. And will likely live forever in a Github database somewhere. So don't do it.
2. ONLY ever update your own homework folder - which should always be your Github username.

Additional expectations & rules may be added later. Please contact me if you need additional clarity on next steps.


# What If I have Questions?

This repo is not yet set up for [Github Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions).

While most people have a Facebook account, your access is also not guaranteed.

So we currently have the following opportunities for you to get your questions answered & receive feedback:

1. **_Contact support_** - please see your welcome email for this email address 

2. **_Facebook Group_** - this group is only for students who took this bootcamp (link sent in your welcome email)

3. **_[Discord Server](https://prosperousheart.com/discord-invite)_** - this is a public server, but there is a special section just for bootcamp students.
