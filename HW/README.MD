**OPTIONAL - [IDE](https://docs.python.org/3/using/editors.html) Use:** run your HW in an interpreter within your preferred app. This can include but is not limited to:
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Atom.io](https://atom.io/)
- [vershd](https://prosperousheart.com/vershd/)

_Otherwise, you can use any text editor._

# How To Submit Homework

The intention behind this bootcamp is to give you a basic foundation of python programming as well as some useful tools.

While you may always email me your code, it is going to be much better for you if you learn how to utilize Github - specifically [collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests).

All of your work will be done & put into [Student_Files](Student_Files/) & according to the "requirements" doc for each assignment.

## What If I have Questions?

This repo is not yet set up for [Github Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions).

While most people have a Facebook account, your access is also not guaranteed.

So we currently have the following opportunities for you to get your questions answered & receive feedback:

1. **_Contact support_** - please see your welcome email for this email address

2. **_Facebook Group_** - this group is only for students who took this bootcamp (link sent in your welcome email)

3. **_[Discord Server](https://prosperousheart.com/discord-invite)_** - this is a public server, but there is a special section just for bootcamp students.

# Planning For Personal Project

This is the part of the bootcamp where you take your knowledge & apply to a real world scenario. In this instance, you are simply determining requirements.

What is a project that would save you time?

Accomplish something you've not seen before?

Is there anything you'd like to do that seems interesting?

In this day and age, anything is possible with programming. Utilize your time in this bootcamp to bounce around ideas & receive guidance on how to complete your programming goals.

# Business Unit (BU) Asks

This is your "homework" - or opportunities to implement what you've been learning.

Just like in the real world, some information may be left out of your instructions. It is up to you, the software developer, to ensure everyone is on the same page & you understand priorities.
