    "## Major Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many benefits to using python. You can easily learn several other languages if you know this one, and there are many additional packages (\"upgrades\" if you will) that you can use on top of this in order to do a vast array of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python is called the programmer's \"beginner language\" yet still supports development of a wide range of applications. (Broad standard library!)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each script (*.py* files) are processed at runtime (not pre-compiled) by an interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Python is interactive. You can directly interact with a prompt (an interpreter) to directly write your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Easy to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Easy to read\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Easy to maintain code\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Interfaces to all major databases\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Has ability to do GUI programming\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Automatic garbage collection\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, & Java\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Optional use of __object-oriented programming__\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming language model organized around _objects_ rather than \"Actions\", & data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data."
