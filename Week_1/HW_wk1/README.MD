Congratulations on completing [week 1](../Week_1) training for Python Basics!

# Week 1 Homework Outline

TBD

# How To Submit Homework

The intention behind this bootcamp is to give you a basic foundation of python programming as well as some useful tools.

While you may always email me your code, it is going to be much better for you if you learn how to utilize Github - specifically [collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests).

# What If I have Questions?

This repo is not yet set up for [Github Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions).

While most people have a Facebook account, your access is also not guaranteed.

So we currently have the following opportunities for you to get your questions answered & receive feedback:

1. **_Contact support_** - please see your welcome email for this email address 

2. **_Facebook Group_** - this group is only for students who took this bootcamp (link sent in your welcome email)

3. **_[Discord Server](https://prosperousheart.com/discord-invite)_** - this is a public server, but there is a special section just for bootcamp students.
