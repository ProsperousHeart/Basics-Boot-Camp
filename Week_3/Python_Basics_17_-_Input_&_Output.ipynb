    "| r+ | Opens a file for **both reading & writing**. File pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. |\n",
    "| w | Opens a file for **writing only** ... Ovewrwrites if the file exists, otherwise creates a new file. |\n",
    "| w+ | Opens a file for **both writing & reading** ... Ovewrwrites if the file exists, otherwise creates a new file for writing and reading. |\n",
    "| a | Opens a file for **appending** with the pointer at the end of the file, if it exists. If file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing. |\n",
