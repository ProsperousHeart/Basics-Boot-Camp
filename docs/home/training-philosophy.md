# Training Philosophy

Based on experience at Cisco training & mentoring over 3k engineers, you need 2 things to be successful in coding:

1. **Basic knowledge of coding**
2. **Implementation time & experience**

A wonderful thing about living in this day & age is the ability to learn anything on the internet. But you must take the time to implement what you've learned.

So this python basic training course is broken down into a 3 week course with implementation work for each section.

## Course Overview

Here is a brief overview of what to expect:

1. **Week 1 + HW 1 (calculator)** - Basic python to familiarize you with working in a py file, GitHub, etc
2. **Week 2 + HW 2 (rock, paper, scissors game)** - Iterators/generators, functions + modules, etc
3. **Week 3 + HW 3 (text reader & writer)** - Input/output, exceptions/assertions, error checking, etc
