# Implementation (Why Homework?)

In all actuality, I could data dump this entire bootcamp for you in 1 hour. But it would be REALLY fast! And with any skill, programming takes time to master - let alone understand the basics. So with each week's training, you will have opportunities with which to implement what you learn.

**Repetition is the mother of all skill**, after all. You create new neural pathways when you learn new things. You create stronger pathways when you create muscle memory (habit) until it seems second nature.

So let's make it fun!

Check out homework assignments in the [HW folder](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/Basics-Boot-Camp/tree/main/HW).

There will be time after each week's training for live Q&A or to answer questions received during the week.


## Overall Objective

The best way to learn is by doing something you already enjoy doing or have interest in.

While I will have assignments for you to complete relating to each week's lessons, be sure to come to this bootcamp thinking about your daily tasks:

- Are there documents you would like to merge together?
- Are there any data story telling or projections you need to make?
- Is there software you would like to emulate or create your own version of?
- Is there something you'd like to do in the realm of philanthropy that your future programming skills could help others?

If you are unable to think of a project, feel free to ask myself or the community. We can brainstorm interesting projects that will provide you with real world experience in:

1. Setting up a project process ([CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) for example)
2. Potential collaboration with others on a "team project"
3. Familiarizing yourself with tools you may use in a future role

... and more!
