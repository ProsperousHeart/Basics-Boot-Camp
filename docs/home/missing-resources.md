# What's Missing?

The following links to [cheatsheets](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets) have been provided for you regarding missing information:

- How to [setup your environment variables](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/SetEnvVars.md)
- How to [setup a virtual environment](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Tools/VirtualEnvironments.md) (process is [here](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/virtualenvs.md))
- [Simple statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html) since there are way more than what I've shared in this bootcamp

You may also benefit from learning how to [configure a Python interpreter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-python-interpreter.html#add-existing-interpreter) - if you decide to use PyCharm.

For GitHub training, check out their [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/).
- Trying to push a commit to GitHub but receive "`remote: Invalid username or password.`"? [Check this out](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34919582).

I also have a ton more resources for those who purchase the course or coaching package!
