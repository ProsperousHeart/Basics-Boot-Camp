# Time Expectations

## Historic Expectations

The original bootcamp was about 2 hours of live training a week for 3 weeks with a bonus 1 hour training that covered social media marketing for job hunting & networking.

This does not include the time to complete each week's implementation needs.

## Current Expectations

As of 2022, we are moving to a new system that will:

- Make it easier for you to learn at your own pace
- Track your progress
- Build a community
- Create an environment where the training will be in byte-sized pieces

I do not yet have an estimate on how long that might take to complete the pre-recorded course, as it is still being setup.
