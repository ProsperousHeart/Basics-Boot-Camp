# Week 3: Input/Output & Exceptions

Welcome to Week 3 - the final week! This week you'll learn how to work with files and handle errors gracefully.

## Overview

In this final week, you'll learn essential skills for building robust applications that interact with the file system and handle errors properly. By the end of this week, you'll understand:

- Reading from and writing to files
- Different file formats and modes
- Exception handling and debugging
- Using assertions for code validation
- Error checking best practices

## Lessons

Work through these lessons in order:

1. **[Input & Output](Python_Basics_17_-_Input_&_Output.md)** - Reading and writing files
2. **[Exceptions & Assertions](Python_Basics_18_-_Exceptions_&_Assertions.md)** - Error handling and debugging
3. **[Additional Links](Python_Basics_19_-_Additional_Links.md)** - Resources for continued learning

## Homework Assignment

**Text Reader & Writer** - Create an application that reads, processes, and writes text files with proper error handling.

Check the [HW folder](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/Basics-Boot-Camp/tree/main/HW) for detailed requirements and starter code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 3, you should be able to:

- Open, read, and write files in various modes
- Handle different file formats (text, CSV, JSON)
- Use context managers (`with` statement) for resource management
- Catch and handle exceptions appropriately
- Raise custom exceptions
- Use assertions for debugging
- Write defensive code that handles errors gracefully

## Estimated Time

- **Lessons**: 1.5-2 hours
- **Homework**: 3-4 hours
- **Total**: 4.5-6 hours

## Key Concepts

### File I/O
Working with files is essential for most applications:
- Opening files with `open()`
- Reading methods: `read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`
- Writing methods: `write()`, `writelines()`
- File modes: 'r', 'w', 'a', 'r+', etc.
- Context managers with `with` statement

### Exception Handling
Write robust code that handles errors:
- Try/except blocks
- Multiple exception types
- Finally clauses
- Raising exceptions
- Custom exception classes
- Assertions for debugging

## Tips for Success

1. **Always use context managers** - Use `with` when working with files
2. **Handle specific exceptions** - Don't use bare `except:` clauses
3. **Provide helpful error messages** - Tell users what went wrong
4. **Clean up resources** - Close files, connections, etc.
5. **Test error conditions** - Make sure your error handling works

## Beyond the Bootcamp

Congratulations on reaching the final week! After completing this week, you'll have a solid foundation in Python. Here's what to do next:

### Continue Learning
- Explore the [Additional Links](Python_Basics_19_-_Additional_Links.md) lesson
- Check out advanced Python topics (OOP, decorators, context managers)
- Learn popular libraries (requests, pandas, numpy)
- Explore web frameworks (Flask, Django)

### Build Projects
The best way to learn is by building:
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Create web scrapers
- Build data analysis tools
- Develop web applications
- Contribute to open source

### Join the Community
- Participate in coding challenges (LeetCode, HackerRank)
- Attend Python meetups
- Join online communities (Reddit r/learnpython, Python Discord)
- Follow Python developers on social media

## Resources

- [Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/)
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/)
- [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/)
- Course instructor's [cheatsheets](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets)

## Final Notes

You've covered a lot of ground in these three weeks! Remember:
- Programming is a skill that improves with practice
- Everyone struggles sometimes - that's part of learning
- The Python community is welcoming and helpful
- Keep building, keep learning, keep coding!

**Good luck with your final homework assignment and your Python journey!**
