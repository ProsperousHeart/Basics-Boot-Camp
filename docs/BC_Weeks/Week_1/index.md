# Week 1: Python Basics

Welcome to Week 1! This week you'll learn the fundamental building blocks of Python programming.

## Overview

In this first week, you'll install Python and learn the basic syntax. By the end of the week, you'll understand:

- Python syntax and basic statements
- Variables and how Python manages memory
- Different types of operators
- How to make decisions in code
- Working with sequences
- Python's built-in data types (numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Type conversions

## Lessons

Work through these lessons in order:

1. **[Introduction](Python_Basics_01_-_Introduction.md)** - Get started with Python installation and setup
2. **[Syntax & Basic Statements](Python_Basics_02_-_Syntax_And_Basic_Statements.md)** - Learn Python's fundamental syntax
3. **[Variables & Garbage Collection](Python_Basics_03_-_Variables_&_Garbage_Collection.md)** - Understand how Python manages memory
4. **[Operators](Python_Basics_04_-_Operators.md)** - Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and more
5. **[Decision Making](Python_Basics_05_-_Decision_Making.md)** - if/elif/else statements
6. **[Sequences](Python_Basics_06_-_Sequences.md)** - Understanding sequential data types
7. **[Numbers](Python_Basics_07_-_Variable_Type_NUMBERS.md)** - Working with integers and floats
8. **[Strings](Python_Basics_08_-_Variable_Type_STRING.md)** - Text manipulation and string methods
9. **[Lists](Python_Basics_09_-_Variable_Type_LIST.md)** - Python's most versatile data structure
10. **[Tuples](Python_Basics_10_-_Variable_Type_TUPLE.md)** - Immutable sequences
11. **[Dictionaries](Python_Basics_11_-_Variable_Type_DICTIONARY.md)** - Key-value pairs
12. **[Type Conversions](Python_Basics_12_-_Type_Conversions.md)** - Converting between data types

## Homework Assignment

**Calculator Project** - Build a basic calculator that can perform arithmetic operations.

Check the [HW folder](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/Basics-Boot-Camp/tree/main/HW) for detailed requirements and starter code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 1, you should be able to:

- Write basic Python programs
- Understand and use variables
- Work with different data types
- Make decisions using conditional statements
- Manipulate strings, lists, and dictionaries
- Convert between different data types

## Estimated Time

- **Lessons**: 2-3 hours
- **Homework**: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 4-6 hours

## Tips for Success

1. **Take your time** - Don't rush through the material
2. **Run the code** - Execute every example in the notebooks
3. **Experiment** - Modify examples to see what happens
4. **Take notes** - Write down key concepts
5. **Ask questions** - Use the community resources

## Next Steps

After completing Week 1 and the homework assignment, move on to [Week 2](../Week_2/index.md) to learn about functions and modules!
