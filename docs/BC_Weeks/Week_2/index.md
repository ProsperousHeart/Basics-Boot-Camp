# Week 2: Functions & Modules

Welcome to Week 2! This week focuses on writing reusable code through functions and organizing code with modules.

## Overview

Building on Week 1's foundation, you'll learn how to write more organized and reusable code. By the end of this week, you'll understand:

- Iterators and generators for efficient data processing
- Creating and using functions
- Variable scope and namespaces
- Organizing code into modules
- Code reusability and best practices

## Lessons

Work through these lessons in order:

1. **[Iterators & Generators](Python_Basics_13_-_Iterators_And_Generators.md)** - Efficient iteration patterns
2. **[Functions](Python_Basics_14_-_Functions.md)** - Creating reusable code blocks
3. **[Scope of Variables](Python_Basics_15_-_Scope_Of_Variables.md)** - Understanding variable visibility
4. **[Modules](Python_Basics_16_-_Modules.md)** - Organizing and importing code

## Homework Assignment

**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game** - Build an interactive game that demonstrates your understanding of functions, decision making, and user interaction.

Check the [HW folder](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/Basics-Boot-Camp/tree/main/HW) for detailed requirements and starter code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 2, you should be able to:

- Create and use functions with parameters and return values
- Understand local vs global scope
- Use iterators and generators for memory-efficient code
- Organize code into reusable modules
- Import and use both built-in and custom modules
- Write cleaner, more maintainable code

## Estimated Time

- **Lessons**: 1.5-2 hours
- **Homework**: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 3.5-5 hours

## Key Concepts

### Functions
Functions are the building blocks of organized code. You'll learn:
- Defining functions with `def`
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Default arguments
- *args and **kwargs

### Modules
Modules help you organize code into logical units:
- Creating your own modules
- Importing modules and specific functions
- Understanding the Python standard library
- Package organization

## Tips for Success

1. **Practice function design** - Think about what each function should do
2. **Use descriptive names** - Function names should explain their purpose
3. **Keep functions focused** - Each function should do one thing well
4. **Comment your code** - Explain complex logic
5. **Test as you go** - Try your functions with different inputs

## Next Steps

After completing Week 2 and the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, move on to [Week 3](../Week_3/index.md) to learn about file I/O and error handling!
