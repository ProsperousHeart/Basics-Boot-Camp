## Tips for Success

### Topic Selection
- Determine target audience FIRST, then brainstorm topics
- Balance complexity with broader appeal
- Technical topics aren't mandatory - soft skills are valuable too
- Simpler, accessible topics often have better selection odds

### Difficulty vs. Audience Level
- **Audience level** = attendee expertise threshold (what they know)
- **Difficulty level** = content complexity YOU control (what you teach)
- Same topic can work at multiple levels

### Talk Complexity
- Avoid overly niche proposals
- Organizers schedule diverse talk levels
- "Intro" talks typically get most conference slots

### Presenter Qualification
- Avoid claiming you're "most qualified" unless you created the project
- Preserve proposal anonymity
- Focus on genuine expertise, not superiority

### The Long Game
- Write 5-8 talks annually during downtime
- Create 2-3 technology-specific + 3-5 broadly applicable talks
- Reuse talks strategically (limit virtual repeats to 2x)
- Request feedback when rejected
- Keep submitting - persistence pays off!
