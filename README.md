# Python Basics Boot Camp

This repo is for my Python Basics Bootcamp students.

Within this repo, you will receive access to the training materials & homework assignments. This is a public repo to provide you with:
- access to the training materials & homework assignments
- opportunity to showcase your work
- an introduction to collaboration with GitHub

While this information is freely available online, the bootcamp experience is only available to those who have secured a seat. You can do so [here](https://prosperousheart.com/python-bootcamp), if enrollment is currently open.

**Enrollment For Dec 2021 closes:**  Dec 11, 2021

Once you have enrolled, you will receive an email with additional instructions - including how to access our Discord server & Facebook group.

# Table Of Contents

Each week there will be a live training with Q&A and assigned homework to help solidify your knowledge.

You will not be graded, however you will receive feedback on your code.

## Week 1

In our first week, you will be installing python and learning basic syntax.

1. [Introduction](Week_1/Python_Basics_01_-_Introduction.ipynb) - including installing Python
2. [Basic Statements](Week_1/Python_Basics_02_-_Syntax_And_Basic_Statements.ipynb)

3. [Additional Links](Week_3/Python_Basics_19_-_Additional_Links.ipynb)

You can check out homework assignments in the [HW folder](HW/).

## What's Missing?

The following links to [my cheatsheets](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets) data has been provided for you regarding missing information.

- how to [setup your environment variables](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/SetEnvVars.md)
- how to [setup a virtual environment](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Tools/VirtualEnvironments.md) (process is [here](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/virtualenvs.md))
- [simple statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html) since there are way more than what I've shared in this bootcamp

You may also benefit from learning how to [configure a Python interpreter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-python-interpreter.html#add-existing-interpreter) - if you decide to use PyCharm.

For GitHub training, check out their [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/).

# Implementation (Why Homework?)

In all actuality, I could data dump this entire bootcamp for you in 1 hour. But it would be REALLY fast! And with any skill, programming takes time to master - let alone understand the basics. So with each week's training, you will have opportunities with which to implement what you learn.

Repetition is the mother of all skill, after all. You create new neural pathways when you learn new things. You create stronger pathways when you create muscle memory (habit) until it seems second nature.

So let's make it fun!

## Overall Objective

The best way to learn is by doing something you already enjoy doing or have interest in.

While I will have assignments for you to complete relating to each week's lessons, be sure to come to this bootcamp thinking about your daily tasks.
- Are there documents you would like to merge together?
- Are there any data story telling or projections you need to make?
- Is there software you would like to emulate or create your own version of?
- Is there something you'd like to do in the realm of philanthropy that your future programming skills could help others?

If you are unable to think of a project, feel free to ask myself or the community. We can brainstorm interesting projects that will provide you with real world experience in:
1. setting up a project process ([CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) for example)
2. potential collaboration with others on a "team project"
3. familiarizing yourself with tools you may use in a future role

... and more!

You can check out homework assignments in the [HW folder](HW/).

There will be time after each week's training for live Q&A or to answer questions received during the week.
