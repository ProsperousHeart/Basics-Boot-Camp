# Python Basics Boot Camp

This repo is for my Python Basics Bootcamp students.

Within this repo, you will receive access to the training materials & homework assignments. This is a public repo to provide you with:
- access to the training materials & homework assignments
- opportunity to showcase your work
- an introduction to collaboration with GitHub

While this information is freely available online, the bootcamp experience is only available to those who have secured a seat. You can do so [here](https://prosperousheart.com/python-bootcamp), if enrollment is currently open.

Be sure to follow this repo to be updated when doors open next.

# Time Expectations

## Historic Expectations

The original bootcamp was about 2 hours a week for 3 weeks with a bonus 1 hour training that covered social media marketing for job hunting & networking.

## Current Expectations

As of 2022, we are moving to a new system that will:
- make it easier for you to learn at your own pace
- track your progress
- build a community
- create an environment where the training will be in byte-sized pieces

I do not yet have an estimate on how long that might take to complete the pre-recorded course, as it is still being setup.

## What Happens When I Enroll?

If you enroll in just the training (no group or 1:1 live sessions) then you will be immediately able to access the basics training course.

If you invested in the live coaching portion, additional details will be outlined within the program.

# Training Expectations

Based on my time at Cisco as a python trainer & mentor to over 3k of my peers, I came to realize you need 2 things to be successful in coding:
1. basic knowledge of coding
2. implementation time & experience

A wonderful thing about living in this day & age is the ability to learn anything on the internet.

But you must take the time to implement what you've learned.

So this python basic training course is broken down into a 3 week course with implementation work for each section. (But I gave the full training in one hour once. So you could tackle the training portion in a single day.)

Here is a brief overview of what to expect:

1. Week 1 + HW 1 (calculator) - basic python to familiarize you with working in a py file, GitHub, etc
2. Week 2 + HW 2 (rock, paper, scissors game) - iterators/generators, functions + modules, etc
3. Week 3 + HW 3 (text reader & writer) - input/output, exceptions/assertions, error checking, etc

# Table Of Contents

This section outlines the Jupyter notebooks that explain everything & include sections to test your understanding.

Originally, the bootcamp consisted of going through these live each week, answering questions, and covering the previous week's work. (Students received direct feedback with their work.) This made it more difficult to really dive into actual coding & ensure students understood the material.

The new system is still set up similarly to this layout. Differences will be outlined as necessary.

All those who purchase the course will be able to watch the trainings, see their progress, and practice using the implementation work provided.

Those who upgrade to live coaching will have greater opportunity to dive into code & receive more direct feedback.

## What's Missing?

The following links to [my cheatsheets](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets) data has been provided for you regarding missing information.

- how to [setup your environment variables](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/SetEnvVars.md)
- how to [setup a virtual environment](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Tools/VirtualEnvironments.md) (process is [here](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/virtualenvs.md))
- [simple statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html) since there are way more than what I've shared in this bootcamp

You may also benefit from learning how to [configure a Python interpreter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-python-interpreter.html#add-existing-interpreter) - if you decide to use PyCharm.

For GitHub training, check out their [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/).
- Trying to push a commit to GitHub but receive "`remote: Invalid username or password.`"? [Check this out](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34919582).

I also have a ton more resources for those who purchase the course or coaching package!

# Implementation (Why Homework?)

In all actuality, I could data dump this entire bootcamp for you in 1 hour. But it would be REALLY fast! And with any skill, programming takes time to master - let alone understand the basics. So with each week's training, you will have opportunities with which to implement what you learn.

Repetition is the mother of all skill, after all. You create new neural pathways when you learn new things. You create stronger pathways when you create muscle memory (habit) until it seems second nature.

So let's make it fun!

## Overall Objective

The best way to learn is by doing something you already enjoy doing or have interest in.

While I will have assignments for you to complete relating to each week's lessons, be sure to come to this bootcamp thinking about your daily tasks.
- Are there documents you would like to merge together?
- Are there any data story telling or projections you need to make?
- Is there software you would like to emulate or create your own version of?
- Is there something you'd like to do in the realm of philanthropy that your future programming skills could help others?

If you are unable to think of a project, feel free to ask myself or the community. We can brainstorm interesting projects that will provide you with real world experience in:
1. setting up a project process ([CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) for example)
2. potential collaboration with others on a "team project"
3. familiarizing yourself with tools you may use in a future role

... and more!

You can check out homework assignments in the [HW folder](HW/).

There will be time after each week's training for live Q&A or to answer questions received during the week.
